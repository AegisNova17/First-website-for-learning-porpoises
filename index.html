    For Learning Porpoises

    <p>
    Dolphins communicate using a variety of whistles, 
    clicks, and pulsed sounds, along with body language.
    They use these sounds to socialize, navigate, and
    hunt. Bottlenose dolphins, for example, have unique
    "signature whistles" that may function like names,
    allowing them to identify each other. While researchers
    haven't discovered a complex language in dolphins like
    human languages, they are actively studying dolphin
    communication to better understand their complex vocalizations
